Hunter Wolfe .bat file license agreement (updated 12/9/19@3AM)

Hello! Hi, yes! So I know you were expecting the GNU GPL V2 but I wanted to simplify my licence file because, let's face it, this kinda shit isn't exactly unique. Just because I created it doesn't mean 1000 other people haven't. Seriously, you can google half the .bat files you see on here and find instructions to create your own in like, 10 minutes flat. So without further ado, let's jump right into it.

-If you download these and modify them for your own use, I ask that you credit me for the creation of em. I don't really give a shit whether you actually do or not, but it'd be nice.

-If you download these, or decide to copy the batch instructions direct from this github page, you agree to remove all references to "ATTR", "A Tear Through Reality", "Fallen Crown Records", "Brinecorp Industries", "The Pychapryl Foundation", and any other brandings, trademarks, logos, or render instructions, that convey, directly or otherwise, intent for artistic/creative use in the visuals for ATTR songs.
